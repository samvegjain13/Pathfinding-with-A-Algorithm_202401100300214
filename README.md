# Pathfinding-with-A-Algorithm_202401100300214
A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm 
which is generally used for finding the 
shortest path in graph, grid etc. Itâ€™s 
speciality is that it will find a solution if one 
such exists only if the conditions satisfy :- 
1) The graph should be finite. 
2) The heuristic used for estimating the 
cost of the goal must be admissible
